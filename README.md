# Py3-NetworkKiller
Very Simple **10-liner** Python3 Script that can be used to overflood the router (loopback-IP) and prevent
anyone on the router from gaining internet access. **The Script is SUPER simple.** 

**To Use:**

Enter Your Local Router's IP *(Usually 192.168.0.1)* and **Launch it!** (Port **8080** is loopback Port, **don't change it**).
