# Py3-NetworkKiller
Very Simple Python3 Script that can be used to overflood the router (loopback-IP) and prevent everyone on the router from gaining internet access.
The Script is SUPER simple. Enter Your Local Router's IP (Usually 192.168.0.1) and Launch it! (Port 8080 is loopback Port, don't change it).
